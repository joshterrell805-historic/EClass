2.3.1.  Navigating Between Slides
<hr>
</h4>
<p>
Figure 1 shows how the user is able to simply navigate between slides with
the directional triangles indicated by the red hand. Intuitively, forward 
triangle to go further into the lecture and backward triangle to backtrack.
<br>
<br>
In addition to this directional way of switching between slides, it is also 
possible to drag the slide manager to quickly preview and flip between slides.
The user may also find it necessary to jump to a specific slide. To do this,
simply change the number above "Slide Number." In this picture, the current
slide is 2, so to go to slide 6 the user would move the cursor over 2, click,
delete, and input 6.

Figure 2 shows what happens when the user has selected to go to the next slide.
The lecture slide, slide number, and layer manager are all updated at the single
click of a button.
