<h4>
2.8.3. Roster Sorting
</h4>
</a>


<p>
The roster is sorted and organized into a way that is meaningful for the presenter to understand.
The '<tt>Questions</tt>' section is organized like a queue.  The student that raises their hand
electronically first is at the top of the '<tt>Questions</tt>' section and students with a
qestion have their hand icon changed to red.  Refer to
<a href="ask-question-raise-hand-overview.html">presenter question management</a> to see how
to view the questions the students have that are listed under the '<tt>Questions</tt>' section.
<p>
Under the '<tt>Attendance</tt>' section, students are listed alphabetically by first name then last
name. This sorting is separate for the individual subsections '<tt>In Class</tt>' and
'<tt>Remote Access</tt>'. Students that are absent from the class are listed under the
'<tt>In Class</tt>' section but have their name grayed out to indicate their absence.
The absent names are listed alphabetically by first name then last name as well.
<p>
Figure 1 shows the '<tt>Roster</tt>' organized into sections and sorted.
