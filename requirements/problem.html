1.1.  Problem Statement
</h3>
</a>
<p>
The general problems to be addressed by the EClass project are the
following:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
to provide a reliable and easy to use software tool that allows teachers and
students to collaborate on lectures electronically in a way comparable to physical media such as
whiteboards
<p> <li>
to provide a way for students and instructors to draw on lectures, ask questions, and gauge the
difficulty of the lecture
<p> <li>
to provide a way for teachers to interact with students, create questions, and
conduct polls
</ol>
While these problems have been solved by a number of commercially available and
public domain products, the EClass tool provides a solution with certain
functional improvements over existing tools.  Specific problem areas are the
following:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
a way for teachers to collapse/expand on certain topics while preserving layers
<p> <li>
providing a tool for students and teachers to gauge the difficulty and understanding of the lecture
<p> <li>
a way to draw on lectures and save lectures for future viewing
</ol>
<p>
The EClass project addresses the requirements of a particular customer.
This customer needs a tool with a collection of features not available in any
single existing tool.  This aspect of the problem is one of combining a set of
existing features in a way that the features have yet to be combined in another
product.
<p>
In addition to the development of functioning software, the EClass project
focuses on two additional problems not addressed in commercial tools:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
multiple user modes where the teacher can allow a student all capabilities of the 
software, permission to draw on their own screen, or total lockdown mode where students can only
watch the lecturee
</ol>
