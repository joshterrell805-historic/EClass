This document details the requirements for an interactive, electronic 
classroom system. The system is designed primarily for educational purposes, 
although it may work just as well for other needs. Instructors can host class 
sessions and students can join as well as participate in a class session. The system includes 
a number of features oriented toward online learning and interaction with the 
instructor. 
<p>
Instructors are presented with a variety of abilities ranging from slide creation 
and modification to live poll conducting with graphical summaries. Students 
benefit from a number of features including a hand-raise gesture, a 
multi-layered interactive whiteboard, and the ability to download lecture 
materials. Overall, the system combines the most useful online lecturing 
tools and features into one convenient product.
