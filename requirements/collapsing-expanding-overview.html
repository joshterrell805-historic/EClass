<p>
Image 1 is the initial state of the presentation in EClass. As soon as
presentation slides are loaded into the application and the presentation is ready to 
be shown, the presenter is presented with something such as image 2.
<br>
<br>
In image 2, the presenter is able to add text information as well as images to
her slide. Slides also have the capability to expand and collapse to show more
information such as source code or more detailed explanations as seen in
image 3. This is done by clicking the + and - to expand and
collapse, respectively.
<br>
<br>
One of the features set up for the expanding slides is the ability to scroll
through the expansion with a scrollbar. This allows both the original
information and the expanded information to be displayed at once.
