2.8.2.  Accessing Student Permissions
</h4>
</a>
<p>
The presenter can access multiple student permissions that either restrict or enable a student to participate in various parts of an EClass session.
<p>
Figure 1 shows how to access the '<tt>Change permissions</tt>' option.

<br>

The presenter accesses the '<tt>Change permissions</tt>' option via the gear next to a student's name. Clicking on the gear produces a drop-down list that includes the '<tt>Change permissions</tt>' option. When the presenter selects the option, the EClass displays a permissions window.
<p>
Figure 2 shows the permissions window after clicking on the '<tt>Change permissions</tt>' option.

<br>

The permissions window displays the student's name in the top right corner so the presenter has easy confirmation of who the open permissions belong to. There are two permissions categories: "Whiteboard" and "Requests/Interactions". 
<p>
The "Whiteboard" category consists of a radio button group with three radio buttons corresponding to the different whiteboard permission levels. The first level is "Unrestricted" and means the student can utilize both private and public whiteboard layers. The student may freely alter the public layers on slides and have the class see them. The "Normal" level is selected by default and allows the student to edit his or her private layers. However, the student can also push private layers to the public presenter stack on a case-by-case basis if the presenter allows it. The final level, titled "Lockdown", prevents the student from making any form of whiteboard layer modification. Additionally, a student in "Lockdown" can no longer navigate between slides. He or she can only see the slide currently selected by the presenter. The <a href="student-navigation-overview.html">student navigation</a> page includes further detail on how slide navigation is affected by the "Lockdown" permission level.
<p>
The "Requests/Interactions" category includes two check box options. The first check box indicates whether or not the student is allowed to raise their hand and ask a question. The second check box indicates whether or not the student is allowed to request pushing a whiteboard layer to the public presenter stack. Both of these check boxes are enabled by default. 
<p>
The presenter clicks '<tt>Accept</tt>' to save any permission changes for the student and close the window. The EClass does not save any changes to the student's permissions if the presenter clicks '<tt>Cancel</tt>'.
<p>
Figure 3 shows the visual effects of the different permissions options.

<br>

The first three students in Figure 3 each have a different whiteboard permissions level. The presenter, as well as the students, view the current permissions level by looking at the foreground box of the layers icon next to each student's name. Brooke has a green box indicating the "Unrestricted" level and Daniel has a yellow box indicating the "Normal" level. The red box in Hayley's slot indicates that she has the "Lockdown" permissions level for whiteboard activity.
<p>
The "Requests/Interactions" permissions have no visual effect when they are checked. Their effects when unchecked are shown in the roster slots for John and Lisa. John's greyed out hand icon indicates that the presenter revoked his ability to raise his hand and ask questions. Lisa has the background box of her layers icon greyed out, which indicates that the presenter revoked her ability to request pushing a public layer to the presenter stack.
<p>
Students who attempt to perform an action that is not currently allowed by their permissions are presented with an informational dialog.
<p>
Figure 4 shows the disallowed action dialog.

</a>
<br>

This is a very simple notification that lets the student know he or she does not have the required permissions to perform an action. The student's only option is to click '<tt>Okay</tt>'. Once '<tt>Okay</tt>' is clicked, the dialog disappears.
