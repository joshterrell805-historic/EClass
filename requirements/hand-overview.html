To use the hand tool, the user moves the cursor over to the '<tt>Drawing Tools</tt>' window and clicks on the hand tool icon. 
As shown in Figure 1, once the hand tool is clicked, the system responds by highlighting the tool and displaying the 
name of the tool in small text under the cursor.

Once the Hand Tool is selected, the user may 'grab' (by clicking and holding) any object created in 
the EClass program or uploaded to the program, as well as any object uploaded to the EClass program.
As shown below in Figure 2, objects that can be moved are (1) &amp; (2) text objects such as arrows

the program. In order to delete an object, the user (1) clicks on the object they wish to delete and 
then (2) clicks the 'backspace/delete' button on their keyboard as shown below in Figure 3.
