2.4.1.  Viewer Lecture Navigation
<hr>
</h4>
<p>
This page will focus on the specifics of student viewer navigation. For a more
general explanation of navigating slides in the EClass tool, visit 
<a href="navigating-overview.html">navigating</a>
<br>
<br>
A student viewing a lecture is not forced to change slides at the exact same
time a presenter changes slides. This is to allow a student to finish taking
notes on his respective layer in case a presenter changes slides too quickly.
Once the student has finished with the slide, he will be able to quickly be able
to go to the current slide the presenter is on through one click of a button.
<br>
<br>
This concept does not apply to skipping forward into the lecture. This is to
prevent lecture viewers to seeing the answer to in-class lecture questions.
Alternatively, if the presenter wants students to be able to see further in to
the lecture he will have to visit the page.
