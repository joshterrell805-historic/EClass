   <h3>1.4.  Impacts</h3>
   <p>Electronic Classroom is a tool which makes presenting more
    interactive even in classic-style classrooms. Electronic Classroom also
    makes note-taking more time-efficient while at the same time providing more
    valuable notes than would usually be available in a classic-style classroom
    setting.</p>
   <p>In an online-lecture style of classroom, Electronic Classroom allows
    a practically limitless amount of students to follow along with a presenter
    as he lectures. The students see the presenter's notes as he writes them
    and Electronic Classroom automatically retains a copy of the presenter's
    notes for the student.</p>
   <h4>Positive Impacts</h4>
   <ul>
      <li>Presenting - EC is a presentation tool which increases the ability of
       the presenter to give informative and reviewable presentations. EC
       enhances the classroom experience by integrating the presenter's
       prefabricated notes with his on-the-fly notes. With EC, there's no more
       switching from projector to whiteboard -- the two are combined.
      <li>Note-taking - Electronic Classroom provides the students with a live
       copy of the presenter notes. Not only are students able to see all the
       presenter's notes as he makes them, but students may take additional
       notes on their own computers, save them, and review them at any time.</li>
      <li>Interacting - EC allows students to interact with other students, the
       presenter, or even the entire class. If a student has a question, he may
       type out his question or
       write it on a layer and submit his question to the presenter. A
       notification displays on the presenter's console where the presenter may
       review the question and display it for all the students to see. The
       presenter may then answer the question himself, or enable the layer
       for editing by selected students if they have an answer.</li>
      <li>Scaling - Because each student has the entire lecture on his own
       computer as it is presented, there is no need to limit classes because of
       physical room size or projector-visibility. Students can watch the same
       presentation in several classrooms, their dorms, or even in a city very
       far away.</li>
   </ul>

   <h4>Negative Impacts</h4>
   <ul>
      <li>application-specific learning - Students and professors that haven't
       used EC yet must get aquainted with the software in order to take
       advantage fully of its time-saving and apprehension-enhancing qualities.
       EC is designed to be user-friendly and as intuitive as possible, but
       as with learning any new tool, there is a certain amount of resources
       that must be expounded in order to know how to use EC optimally.</li>
      <li>distraction - both the presenter and students can easily get
       distracted with so much going on. Drawings, the roster, approval tracker,
       and forum...there's a lot that could potentially take away from the
       content of the lecture.
   </ul>

   <h4>Neutral Impacts</h4>
   <ul>
      <li>market-shift - EC shifts the market which may be viewed as positive
       and negitive. EC promotes the usage of projects over whiteboards. It also
       increases the need for laptops or classroom computers.</li>
   </ul>
