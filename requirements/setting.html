1.3.  Operational Setting
</h3>
</a>
<p>
<font color=black><p>The main operational setting for the Electric Classroom (henceforth referred to as EClass) 
is as a replacement to the (1) standard Cal Poly CS department classroom lecture with whiteboard/blackboard and marker/chalk.
<p>As of current, secondary and tertiary settings are (2) other Cal Poly classroom lecture and (3) other university campuses 
respectively. We may consider features that might be useful to settings (2) and (3) that may not be immediately useful in setting 
(1), as long as those features do not interfere with setting (1) and are not overly complicated. The setting for which it is 
appropriately suited is a classroom setting with a dedicated EClass machine for each student and an EClass machine for the 
professor where lectures would strictly take place on the EClass machines. The tool is designed to completely replace 
conventional teaching/lecturing methods with whiteboards/blackboards and projectors. <p>As noted in the preceding section 
on system personnel, the primary customer for the EClass is anyone who wishs to use the tool as an educational device. 
As such, the tool's requirements reflect the point of view of the customer base, including their work setting.</p>
