<p>
The presenter has the option to broadcast both audio and video during a presentation. The students are able to view and listen to such a broadcast once it is live. The '<tt>Audio/Video</tt>' button is located in the top right of the main EClass window. 
<p>
Figure 1a shows the presenter's '<tt>Audio/Video</tt>' button and figure 1b shows the student version.

There are some minor differences between the presenter and student versions of the '<tt>Audio/Video</tt>' button. The presenter's button includes a microphone and the term "Broadcast" while the student button includes a volume icon and the term "Enable". These are subtle differences to make the button's effect clearer.
<p>
When the presenter clicks the '<tt>Audio/Video</tt>' button, the EClass creates an audio and video stream that students can open (or enable). Both the presenter's and student's '<tt>Audio/Video</tt>' button display a new window for the stream when clicked.
<p>
Figure 2 shows the '<tt>Audio/Video</tt>' window.

The '<tt>Audio/Video</tt>' window contains a video stream and audio slider for adjusting the volume. If the presenter or student would no longer like to have the stream open, they close the window with the 'X' in the upper right. However, the presenter does not stop broadcasting by closing the window. The presenter must click the '<tt>Audio/Video</tt>' button again to terminate an ongoing broadcast.
<p>
Figure 3 shows the presenter's '<tt>Audio/Video</tt>' button when a broadcast is live.

The only difference is a green overlay on the button. To stop broadcasting, the presenter clicks on the '<tt>Audio/Video</tt>' button. It then returns to its original state and the EClass stops the broadcast.

<p>
While the EClass provides the means for broadcasting and viewing an audio/video stream, it does not support saving the stream. Students who want to view or listen to the stream are required to be connected to the EClass as the presenter broadcasts it. However, students and presenters alike are free to record streams using a third-party tool or application if they choose to do so.
