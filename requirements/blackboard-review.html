1.5.3.  Blackboard Virtual Classroom
</h4>
</a>
<p>
Blackboard Virtual Classroom is used in many highschools throughout 
the nation today. The application allows student and teacher
to interact through the web. Blackboard does infact provide
many of the features required by the specification but does lack a few
as well. One feature the application allows for is out of the classroom
lectures, where the teacher is able to broadcast his or her voice
and video camera feed through the web.
<p>
Overall, Blackboard provides a strong basis for a virtual classroom and provides
the necessary features to educate over the web.
<p>
<strong>Good Features:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Controls for allowing individual users certain acceses/restrictions
<li>
Simple question queue where students are able to ask
questions and the teacher is able to answer them at his discretion
<li>
User list that shows all participants in the classroom and
their respective role, i.e, student, assistant, teacher
<li>
Capability for lecture slides as well as teacher video and
audio feed on the same screen
<li>
Whiteboard feature allows for cutting, pasting, and moving items
on the virtual whiteboard. Free drawing is also available
<li>
Groub browser feature allows a classroom to collectively browse
the internet, i,e, watch youtube videos, use a web-app
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Bad Features:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
GUI is somewhat hard to navigate and many features are jumbled
together instead of separate buttons for each
<li>
Requires a separate Blackboard account (not student ID) to
register and login with
<li>
Closed source, so there are no third party extensions to expand
application capabilities
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Missing Features:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
No way to represent different layers on the whiteboard
<li>
Missing the ability to poll students on level of understanding
<li>
No way to expand a topic on a lecture slide for more detail
<li>
Switching between lecture slides and virtual whiteboard is not
straight forward and requires multiple button presses
<li>
Lecture slides cannot be used to write on directly
<li>
Saving and opening previous whiteboard drawings is not possible
directly through the application
</ul>
