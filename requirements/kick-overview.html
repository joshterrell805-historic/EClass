2.8.4  Kicking a Student
</h4>

<p>
There are a number of situations where a presenter may want to kick a student from an ongoing EClass session. When a student becomes unruly or disruptive, the presenter has a quick and simple way to remove the student from the EClass session.
<p>
Figure 1 shows how to access the '<tt>Kick</tt>' option.

The presenter accesses the '<tt>Kick</tt>' option via the gear next to a student's name ("Ben W" in this scenario). Clicking on the gear produces a drop-down list that includes the '<tt>Kick</tt>' option. When the presenter selects the option, the EClass displays a confirmation dialog.
<p>
Figure 2 shows the confirmation dialog that appears after clicking on the '<tt>Kick</tt>' option.

<br>

The dialog asks if the presenter is sure about kicking the student and includes the student's name. The dialog closes and nothing changes if the presenter selects '<tt>Cancel</tt>'. If the presenter clicks '<tt>Yes</tt>', then the student is kicked from the EClass session. The EClass disables the student from rejoining the session and the roster window reflects the student's new status.
<p>
Figure 3 shows the updated roster after a presenter has selected '<tt>Yes</tt>' in the kick confirmation dialog.

The kicked student moves to the bottom of the roster. Similar to students who are absent, the roster covers the kicked student's name with a grey overlay to designate that he or she is no longer present. Additionally, the roster displays a red 'X' across the kicked student's roster slot. The red 'X' allows the presenter to distinguish between ordinary absences and absences due to kicking.
<p>
The roster does not maintain the kicked status and associated red 'X' between EClass sessions.
