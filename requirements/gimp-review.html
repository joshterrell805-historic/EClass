      <h4>1.5.6 GIMP - The GNU Image Manipulation Program</h4>
      <p>
         This is an analysis focused on the drawing and layering capabilities of
         the GNU Image Manipulation Program. GIMP is a full-fledged image editor
         comparable with photoshop; it has a plethora of features.
      </p>
      <h4 title>Good Features:</h4>
      <ul>
         <li>Layering</li>
            <ul>
               <li>Create - Create any number of layers </li>
               <li>Delete - delete a layer</li>
               <li>Order - Reorder layers (front to back)</li>
               <li>Name - Name and rename layers</li>
               <li>Modify Attributes - Change visibility and opacity of layers
                </li>
            </ul>
         <li>Drawing</li>
            <ul>
               <li>Text - Add text box, change color, change font (size,
                style, face). Move text box delete it.</li>
               <li>Lines - Supports freestyle and straight</li>
               <li>Color - Specify color and change color of elements</li>
            </ul>
      </ul>
      <h4 title>Bad Features:</h4>
      <ul>
         <li>Text boxes in gimp are their own layers. Text boxes as layers in EC
          clutters the layers panel. Text boxes in EC are elements belonging to
          layers so they are still editable yet don't each take up their own
          layer.</li>
         <li>In GIMP, drawings are added directly onto the layer. For the
          Electronic Classroom, drawings (such as lines and shapes)
          are individual elements so they can be moved and manipulated.
          Drawing elements belong to an owner layer so they
          are hidden and their opacity changes when the layer's opacity changes.
          Drawings in EC are selectable, resizeable, and moveable.</li>
         <li>Colors in GIMP 
          are supported like an image editor needs them to be.
          Colors in the Electronic Classroom are used in note-taking and
          in presentation to give additional meaning. A simple pallete
          is used (possibly configureable), rather than a color wheel with 
          the full range of 32-bit colors</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 title>Missing Features:</h4>
      <p>The following list only addresses features relevant to drawing and
       layers. GIMP is not an electronic classroom; it is an image manipulation
       program. As such, it is missing the vast majority of the features of
       the Electronic classroom.</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Shapes - GIMP does support shapes, but they are cumbersome
          to use. EC supports basic shapes such as rectangles,
          triangles, and circles similar to how Microsoft Word implements shapes
          .</li>
         <li>Drawings in the EC are individually
          (or collectively) selectable. Drawings belong to a layer. In GIMP
          drawn elements are direclty part of the layer. Drawn elements lose
          their individuality after they are drawn. In EC, elements
          retain their individuality. Drawings are modifiable after they are
          connected to the layer.</li>
      </ul>
