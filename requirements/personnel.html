1.2.  System Personnel
</h3>
</a>
<p>
The personnel involved in the Electronic Classroom project are organized into the
following groups and subgroups:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
end users
<ol type=i>
<p> <li>
students (In-class and Out-of-class)
<p> <li>
educators
</ol>
<p> <li>
project managers
<p> <li>
domain experts
<p> <li>
customers
<p> <li>
system developers
</ol>
<p>
End users for the Electronic Classroom project are all those who will use the
tool for educational purposes. Whether they may be a student or an educator,
the goal of the project is to benefit their learning or teaching capabilities.
Students comprise of both in class students as well as out of class students.
The application will hopefully be able to bring in class activities such as
asking a question, answering a question, and taking notes to a remote environment.
While students will be focused on what they can take from the program to learn,
teachers will be doing the inverse in seeing what they can input as information.
<p>
While Gene Fisher definitely plays a large role in the developement of the
Electronic Classroom, he plays more the role of a advisor than a manager.
The role of project manager more so lies in the small development team designing
the program. In the end, Gene Fisher can only guide us with what features he
wishes to have so much and it is up to us to make the final decisions.
<p>
Domain experts will be a joint effort between students and educators, as they
will be the end users. As an educator and customer it is up to Gene Fisher to
inform us on what are efficient tools and what can be left out. As students, it
is the team's job to know what helps with learning and what is too laborious.
In the end, it is a tool that fits both these domains that will be the best.
<p>
Customers may include all who wish to use the tool as an educating device. The
took will be built so that educators are able to provide their material remotely
so a traditional classroom is not required. Though the main customer is Gene
Fisher and the specification of the project will appeal almost entirely to his
specific needs.
<p>
System devoplers may also wish to incorporate the Electronic Classroom into
their own suite of applications for education. The tool will most likely be
built to be used with other tools as well.
