1.5.1. Cisco WebEx Confencing
</h4>
</a>
<p>
WebEx web conferencing is a great way to work with people in other locations.
WebEx technology allows you to meet, collaborate, present, and share content - all on the web. Meet face-to-face with HD video conferencing. Share your entire desktop, or specific documents or apps, with everyone in the meeting. Participants can also give "remote control" to others for demonstration or support purposes.
<p>
Overall, WebEx is a viable option for hosting online classroom sessions and video 
conferences.
<p>
<strong>Good Features:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Invite and remind participants:</strong> invite participants to an online meeting (lecture) that has already started via email, voice conference, or instant messenger, and send reminders about upcoming meetings (lectures)
<li>
<strong>Use integrated WebEx audio:</strong> create a more productive meeting (lecture) experience with integrated WebEx audio - the active talker feature allows you to easily indentify who is speaking and the mute feature enables you to silence everyone or selected individuals, then simply unmute to restore volume
<li>
<strong>Record your meeting (lecture):</strong> record your actions during your meeting (lecture) so you can review the discussion at a later time, or send to colleagues who couldn't attend
<li>
<strong>Share content:</strong> get everyone on the same page. Open any document or application and discuss it in real time with other participants - the virtual whiteboard feature acts just like a conventional whiteboard or flip chart by allowign you to brainstorm and take notes; participants will see everything you write or draw and, if assigned annotation privileges, they will be able to use the whiteboard as well
<li>
<strong>Pass the ball:</strong> let other participants share and present documents from their computers and assign privleges to indiviudal participants - as a host or presenter, you can specify privileges to allow or deny specific functions to participants such as annotate, save, share, record
<li>
<strong>Transfer files:</strong> avoid sending emails back and forth by exchanging files - no matter how large - in your meeting (lecture) quickly, easily, and securely
<li>
<strong>Interact within a meeting:</strong> use polling and chat, and learn how to integrate webcams into your meeting (lecture) for a more personal experience
</ul>
