2.5.1.  Student Question Asking
</h4>
</a>
<p>
The student has the option to ask a question at any point during a presentation. The '<tt>Raise Hand</tt>' button is located in the top right corner of the student view of the EClass. 
<p>
Figure 1 shows the student's view of the presentation and the location of the '<tt>Raise Hand</tt>' button.

Once the student has clicked the '<tt>Raise Hand</tt>' button, the prompt shown in Figure 2a appears. The student then fills in the question area with their question and hits '<tt>Submit</tt>' to send the question to the presenter. 
<p>
If the student doesn't need or want to ask the question anymore, they simply click the '<tt>Raise Hand</tt>' button again and their hand comes down. On the presenter's screen, there is no longer any indicator that this particular student has their hand raised anymore.
<p>
Figure 2a shows the '<tt>Raise Hand</tt>' question form and Figure 2b shows it filled in.
