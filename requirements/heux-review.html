1.5.2. Heux
</h4>
</a>
<p>
Heux is a great tool for interactive learning in the classroom.  Teachers can upload their already
existing powerpoint files and any other files they may need and Heux will use those files as
the whiteboard.  Students can view on their screens the information that the teacher is sharing with
them.  Students can draw on their own screens and share what they have drawn with the teacher.  Heux
conducts polls on topics created by the teacher and students can submit their answers through
the application.
<p>
Overall, Heux is a good option for hosting online classroom sessions.
