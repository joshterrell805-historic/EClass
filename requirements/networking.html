   <h2 class="page-title" id="top">Networking in EClass</h2>
   <p>This document contains conceptual information about how EClass communcates
   with other programs over the network. There are three types of applications
   used in networking:</p>
   <dl>
      <dt>EClass (presenter)</dt>
         <dd>This is the application that 
         the presenter runs. For networking, this progam is the
         server that all students connect to to view a lecture, post messages to
         the forum, etc. See <a href="presenter-overview.html">
         Presenter UI Overview</a>.</dd>
      <dt>EClass (student)</dt>
         <dd>This is the application the student uses
         to connect to a presentation. Here the student may take notes, ask a
         question, rate a presentation, etc. See
         <a href="student-ui-overview.html">Student UI Overview</a>.</dd>
      <dt>Central Server</dt>
         <dd>This application is the central server used behind the scenes by 
         both the student
         and the presenter applications for authentication purposes.
         When the user logs in, his credentials are
         sent to this server. Also, this server is responsible for obtaining
         informaiton about which classes a student is enrolled in and which
         classes a presenter may open a presentation for.</dd>

   <h3 id="central-server">Central Server</h3>
   <p>The central server is the server that EClass connects to
   when the user attempts to login. There is one
   central server per school or other presentation facility.</p>
   <p>In authentication, the central server calls a user-plugin. Using 
   a plugin allows different schools to implement different login procedures
   depending on the software the school uses for student/professor
   authentication. The authentication plugin gets called
   by the central server with the username and the password, and is
   responsible for responding with whether the credentials are valid (as
   well as some other information). See <a href="#authentication-plugin">
   Authentication Plugin</a>.</p>
   <p>With the information obtained from the authentication plugin, the
   central server holds a list of the logged in students and professors
   and the courses
   they are enrolled in. When a student authenticates, he receives the
   courses he is enrolled in so he may join a presentation. When a presenter
   logs in and chooses to host a presentation, he chooses from a list of
   classes he
   may present for. These lists are discussed
   further in <a href="#login">Student/Presenter Authentication</a>,
   <a href="#join-presentation">Joining a Presentation (student)</a>, and
   <a href="#host-presentation">Hosting a Presentation (presenter)</a>.</p>

   <h3 id="authentication-plugin">Authentication plugin</h3>
   <p>The authentication plugin is called by the central server when a user
   attempts
   to authenticate. This plugin is a python module with two functions:
   <tt>login</tt> and <tt>logout</tt>.</p>
   <dl id="plugin-method-contract">

   <h3 id="login">Student/Presenter Authentication</h3>
   <p>When the EClass application is distributed to students and professors, it
   includes an authentication configuration file containing the following:</p>
   <ol>
      <li>The IP address of the central server</li>
      <li>The port of the central server</li>
      <li>The public key of the central server</li>
   </ol>
   <p>These values are used to connect to the central server.</p>
   <p>The login process is as follows:</p>
   <ol>
      <li>EClass opens an ssl-encrypted socket with the authentication
         server using the provided ip, port, and public key.</li>
      <li>EClass sends the <tt>username</tt> and <tt>password</tt> to the
         central server requesting a new session.</li>
      <li>The central server passes the <tt>username</tt> and
         <tt>password</tt> to the authentication plugin which responds
         with either a failure object or a success object.</li>
   </ol>
   failure
   <ol start=4>
      <li>The authenticaiton server passes the failure message back to the
         client</li>
   </ol>
   success
   <ol start=4>
      <li>The central server creates a new logged in user with the user's
         <tt>username</tt>, <tt>pluginToken</tt>, the presenter/student
         <tt>role</tt> of the user, and
         the <tt>courses</tt> the presenter/student is in.
         </li>
      <li>The central server replies to EClass with the user's
         <tt>role</tt> and <tt>classes</tt>.
      </li>
   </ol>
   <p>After success, EClass differentiates into the presenter or student mode.
      A presenter may <a href="#host-presentation">host a presentation</a> for
      any of their classes, and a student may
      <a href="#join-presentatation">join a hosted presentation</a> for any of
      their classes.</p>
   <p>Return to the <a href="#top">top</a> of this page.</p>


   <h3 id="host-presentation">Hosting a Presentation</h3>
   <p>Once a presenter has authenticated and has an open presentation, he may
      host that presentation to one of his classes. There is no UI discussion
      for this at the moment, but the way in which to host a presentation will
      be obvious.</p>
   <p>To host a presentation, EClass sends the following to the authentication
      server in its request to host a presentation:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>class - the class the professor wishes to host a presentation for</li>
      <li>port - the port the professor's EClass application listens for
         incomming student connections on. This port is a randomly chosen open
         port on the professor's machine.</li>
      <li>public key - the public ssl-key students use to encrypt thier
         sockets with when connecting to this server.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Note: The IP students' EClass applications are given to connect to is the
      same IP that this request is comming from.</p>
   <p>The central server replies with a success or failure.</p>
   <dl>
      <dt>failure</dt>
         <dd>If the presenter is already hosting a presentation, the presenter
            is not logged in, or the class given is not a class the presenter
            is allowed to host a class for.</dd>
      <dt>success</dt>
         <dd>Return an array of objects containing the usernames, first names,
            and last names
            of the students enrolled in the course. This array
            is the <tt>students</tt> field of the corresponding
            <tt>class-object</tt> in the <tt>classes</tt> array
            of the success object returned from the 
            <a href="#authentication-plugin">authentication plugin</a> when
            the presenter authenticates.</dd>
   </dl>
   <p>After receiving a success response from the central server about
      hosting a presentation, the presenter's EClass is
      ready for incomming students on the port specified in the host request.
      The protocol for accepting new students is described in the section on 
      <a href="#join-presentation">joining a presentation</a>.</p>
   <p>Return to the <a href="#top">top</a> of this page.</p>


   <h3 id="join-presentation">Joining a Presentation</h3>
   <p>Once a student has authenticated, he may join a presentation. See
   <a href="student-ui-overview.html#list">Selecting a Class</a> for the UI
   portion of this discussion.</p>
   <p>Upon authenticaiton, EClass receives an array of <tt>class-objects</tt>
      with the courses he is enrolled in. These <tt>class-objects</tt> are the
      same objects
      returned by the the authentication plugin upon student success with
      one difference: the central server adds a <tt>hosted</tt> attribute
      to each class. The <tt>hosted</tt> attribute is always included on every
      <tt>class-object</tt>, and its value may either be <tt>true</tt> or
      <tt>false</tt> for
      whether or not a presentation is currently being hosted for this class.
      The states values of these objects can be updated at any time by sending
      an update request to the server (relativley simple, not documented here).
      </p>
   <p>To join a class, EClass sends a request to the central server containing
      the class the student wishes to join. The central server responds with one
      of two objects:</p>
   <dl>
      <dt>success</dt>
         <dd>
            <p>success [boolean] true</p>
            <p>ip [string] ip of presenter's EClass</p>
            <p>port [int] port to connect to</p>
            <p>publicKey [string] the ssl public key of the presenter</p>
            <p>connectionToken [string] a one time use connection token to be
               sent to the presenter's EClass when logging in</p>
         </dd>
      <dt>failure</dt>
         <dd>
            <p>success [boolean] false</p>
            <p>reason [string] why the student failed to get connectionToken.
               some possbile reasons are: not logged in, and the class requested
               isn't hosted</p>
         </dd>
   </dl>
   <p>Once the student's EClass has the connection token, it sends a request
      to the presenter's EClass at the ip and port returned from the success
      response. It uses the public key returned to establish an ssl-ecrypted
      connection to that machine.</p>
   <p>The request to join the presentation simply includes the
      <tt>connectionToken</tt>.</p>
   <p>When the presenter's EClass receives the <tt>connectionToken</tt>, it
      sends off a request to the central server to determine if the
      <tt>connectionToken</tt> is legitamate. The central server looks up the
      connection token and responds with one of two objects:</p>
   <dl>
      <dt>success</dt>
         <dd>
            <p>success [boolean] true</p>
            <p>username [string] the username of the student associated with
               this <tt>connectionToken</tt></p>
         </dd>
      <dt>failure</dt>
         <dd>
            <p>success [boolean] false</p>
            <p>reason [string] the conneciton token is invalid</p>
         </dd>
   </dl>
   <p>The presenter's EClass responds back to the client with success or
      failure.</p>
   <p>If successful the client and server use this currently open socket for
      the remainder of their communications including adjusting the student's
      approval rating, asking a quesiton, posting a message to the forum,
      etc.</p>
   <p>On failure, the server hangs up the connection.</p>
   <p>Return to the <a href="#top">top</a> of this page.</p>

   <h3 id="connectivity">Log out, stop hosting a presentation,
      and connection lost</h3>
   <p>For the time being, EClass operates on an "always open socket"
      methodology. If the student or presenter ever looses connection, this is
      equivalent to logging out and the whole login process must begin again.
      Some limitations of this methodology are increased network useage and
      possible
      dropped presentations/students during the middle of presentations if there
      are network issues.
      However, the extra complication of reopening and authenticating
      a socket with the same credentials it previously had is not currently
      implemented. If time allows, this feature will be implemented.</p>
   <p>Logging out and halting a presentation are as simple as killing the
      sockets. If the presenter wishes to logout all students currently logged
      in, he simply closes all connections to students. If he wishes to stop
      hosting his presentation, he stops listening for
      connections and closes his connection to the central server and the
      stuents (a stop-hosting request may be added later).</p>
   <p>If a student wishes to log out of a presentation, he closes his connection
      with the presentation. If he wishes to log out of the central server, he
      closes his connection with the central server.</p>
