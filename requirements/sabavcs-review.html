1.5.4. Saba Virtual Classroom Software
</h4>
</a>
<p>
Saba Virtual Classroom Software (SVCS) is an interactive classroom software 
with a wide variety of supported features. While it is specifically titled 
for classrooms, its features are generalized enough to support a number of 
various online meetings and conferences. SVCS appears to be relatively 
unknown but offers an impressive suite of interactive features on multiple 
platforms including computers (via Web browser), mobile phones, and tablets.
<p>
Overall, SVCS is a viable option for hosting online classroom sessions and video 
conferences.
