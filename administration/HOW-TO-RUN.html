For convenience, here is a link to our documentation:

Also a note for the documentation, @author tags are only included in the
documentation files and not the source files. We discussed this with you in a
meeting during class. One other thing is that the drawing tool contains images
which are not in the correct .png bitmap format, we have suppressed the warnings
which causes the tool not to work on Macs but all other tools work.
