<h1 align=center>HOW TO RUN EClass</h1>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<ol>
   <li>Make sure Python version 2.7.X is installed. This is the version
      our team used and we know wxPython is supported in</li>
   <li>Make sure wxPython version 3.0 is installed. This is the version
      our team used and we know is supported by Python 2.7.X</li>
   <li>Make sure twisted is installed
      <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads</a></li>
   <li>Once twisted is installed, make sure twisted install path is on your PYTHONPATH. It's in /lib/.... do a find to find it</li>
   <ol>
      <li>`sudo find / -name twisted`</li>
      <li>`export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python` is what worked on Andrew's mac</li>
      <li>NOTE: it's not ../lib/python/twisted  ... it's  .../lib/python</li>
   </ol>
   <li>Make sure webkit is installed (should be pre-installed on mac)</li>
   <li>The path where the program is to be ran from is: 
      <tt>http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~kle17/EClass/implementation/source/python/</tt></li>
   <li>In order to log in, the server must be running. To run the server, run
      <tt>python main.py server</tt> from a separate terminal</li>
   <li>To run the program simply run the command: <tt>python main.py</tt></li>
   <li>To authenticate, your username is `gfisher` and no password is required.</li>
   <li>It is now possible to launch a student user that is connected with the presenter through the server. To do this, open up another instance of EClass
       and login with the username 'student'. From the Professor terminal, a print message will display the user joining and when they leave as well.</li>
   <li>'student' can only join a presentation when the professor is hosting one.</li>
</ol>

For convenience, here is a link to our documentation: 
<a href="../design/index.html">EClass Doc</a>
<br>
Also a note for the documentation, @author tags are only included in the
documentation files and not the source files. We discussed this with you in a
meeting during class. 
<br>
<br>
Drawing tools currently work in a very crude way, and ONLY on Windows as far as we know. We believe this is a problem with the underlying Webkit rendering
engine that Mac and Linux boxes use for web browsing. To use this on Windows, simply click anywhere on the presentation window and a circle will render.
