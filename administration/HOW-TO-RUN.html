<h1 align=center>HOW TO RUN EClass</h1>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<ol>
   <li>Make sure Python version 2.7.X is installed. This is the version
      our team used and we know wxPython is supported in</li>
   <li>Make sure wxPython version 3.0 is installed. This is the version
      our team used and we know is supported by Python 2.7.X</li>
   <li>Make sure twisted is installed
      <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads</a></li>
   <li>Once twisted is installed, make sure twisted install path is on your PYTHONPATH. It's in /lib/.... do a find to find it</li>
   <ol>
      <li>`sudo find / -name twisted`</li>
      <li>`export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python` is what worked on Andrew's mac</li>
      <li>NOTE: it's not ../lib/python/twisted  ... it's  .../lib/python</li>
   </ol>
   <li>Make sure webkit is installed (should be pre-installed on mac)</li>
   <li>The path where the program is to be ran from is: 
      <tt>http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~kle17/EClass/implementation/source/python/</tt></li>
   <li>In order to log in, the central server must be running. To run the central server, run
      <tt>python main.py server</tt> from a separate terminal</li>
   <li>To run the program simply run the command: <tt>python main.py</tt></li>
   <li>To authenticate, your username is `gfisher` and no password is required.</li>
   <li>It is now possible to launch a student user that is connected with the presenter through the central server. To do this, open up another instance of EClass
       and login with the username 'student'. From the Professor terminal, a print message will display the user joining and when they leave as well.</li>
   <li>'student' can only join a presentation when the professor is hosting one.</li>
</ol>
<br>
For convenience, here is a link to our documentation: 
<a href="../design/index.html">EClass Doc</a>
<br>
Also a note for the documentation, @author tags are only included in the
documentation files and not the source files. We discussed this with you in a
meeting during class. 
<br>
<br>
NOTE: If you run EClass on Windows, there is occasionally an issue with student syncing where their whiteboard will not sync up with the presenter every time the slide is changed due to our need for using wx's version of Sleep(). It's possible this may occur on Mac/Linux as well but we have not encountered it on those platforms yet.
<br>
<br>
While EClass works pretty well in the three major operating systems (Linux, Mac, Windows), they each ultimately have some unique quirks when interacting with wxPython. If you run into something strange (you shouldn't, but if you do...) please see if it occurs on one of the other operating systems as it may be an issue with only one platform.
