   <li>Make sure Python version 2.7.X is installed. This is the version
      our team used and we know wxPython is supported in</li>

      <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/</a></li>

   <li>The path where the program is to be ran from is: 
      <tt>http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~kle17/EClass/implementation/source/python/</tt></li>
   <li>To run the program simply run the command: <tt>python main.py</tt></li>
   <li>In order to log in, the server must be running. To run the server, run
      <tt>python main.py server</tt> from a separate terminal</li>

For convenience, here is a link to our documentation: 
<a href="../design/index.html">EClass Doc</a>
<br>
Also a note for the documentation, @author tags are only included in the
documentation files and not the source files. We discussed this with you in a
meeting during class.

One other thing currently is that when opening HTML documents on Apple machines,
if the directory or filename has a space in it the file will not be loaded. This
is a known issue and we are looking for a solution. One workaround is to
load files from the root directory or User/.
