   <li>Python's '<tt>unittest</tt>' module is used so no download should be necessary.</li>
   <li>Navigate to the testing/implementation/unit directory.</li>

Unfortunately there are some weird interactions between files and using sys.insert to add files to the paths and importing files in Python. This lead to PresentationTest starting to give random import errors at the last minute when it was working fine before. Although it says the tests all fail, it is simply because of an import error that should not be happening.
