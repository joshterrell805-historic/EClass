    <td valign=top>Add a Message to the list of messages for the forum
    <td valign=top>Select 'Show Forum' in the 'View' menu item -> type in a message then press the send button
    <td valign=top>The typed in message should appear in the message area with the username, date and time, and message

    <td valign=top>Sorts the roster in ascending order
    <td valign=top>Select 'Show Roster' in the 'View' menu item
    <td valign=top>The names in the roster can be visually seen to be in alphabetical order

    <td valign=top>N/A
    <td valign=top>Visit <a href="../documentation/design/networking.html">Networking in EClass</a> and see EClass.Connection package in docs

    <td valign=top>Josh Terrell
    <td valign=top>Implement Authorizaiton and hosting aspects of central server and Connection
    <td valign=top>To run the server, run `python main.py server` you must have <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/">twisted</a> installed. To see authorization work, simply login as normal
    <td valign=top>When you run the server, it should show that the server is listening on port 1234 (this port can be changed in model/Conection/config.json). When logging in, the server will print that it got the request and the client will succeed or fail based on if the username is in the allowed usernames. your username is gfisher (login as presenter). to test a student, try jmterrel as the login name. No password is required. All the possible logins are in model/Connection/Connections/CentralServer_AuthPlugin_Simple.py

    <td valign=top>Joel Wilcox
    <td valign=top>Slidify a presentation file.
    <td valign=top>Click on 'Open Presentation' at the main EClass screen. Choose a presentation (HTML) file and click 'Select'. A sample presentation with six slides can be <a href="../testing/SampleFisherLecture.html">found here</a>.
    <td valign=top>The presentation file's contents will be broken up into slides that can be viewed and navigated through via the whiteboard navigation controls. (NOTE: There will only be one slide if the presentation HTML contains no slide breaks)

  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Joel Wilcox
    <td valign=top>Navigate between slides.
    <td valign=top>After selecting a presentation to open, you can click the 'Previous', 'Next', or 'SYNC' buttons to change slides. You can also enter a number in the text box which says 'Slide Number' to go to a specific slide.
    <td valign=top>Clicking 'Previous' will change to the previous slide (if there is one). Clicking 'Next' will change to the next slide (if there is one). Clicking 'SYNC' will currently only print a message to console until we are further along with networking. Entering a valid slide number into the 'Slide Number' text box will change to that slide. This can all be seen visually as the controls are used. (NOTE: The 'SYNC' button will only be visible if you log in with a student id like 'student')

  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Joel Wilcox
    <td valign=top>View and change a Student's permissions.
    <td valign=top>With the Roster window open, click on the black arrow next to a student's name. Then click on the 'Permissions' button and make any desired changes to the radio buttons and check-boxes. Then click 'Accept' to save the permissions or 'Cancel' to discard the changes.
    <td valign=top>After closing the Permissions window, click on the 'Permissions' button again to reopen it and view the changes if any were made. The new permissions can be seen by the radio button and check-box states. If changes were made but discarded, you'll be able to see that the permissions are the same as they were initially.

    <td valign=top>Kevin Le
    <td valign=top>Open a HTML Presentation
    <td valign=top>Click on 'Open Presentation' at the main EClass screen. Choose a presentation (HTML) file and click 'Select'.
    <td valign=top>The presentation document should appear on the main window. The document supports CSS and Javascript. In the future we will have a collapsible feature will take take advantage of the CSS.

  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Kevin Le
    <td valign=top>Opening/Closing of view menu items
    <td valign=top>Click on 'View' from the Menubar and select any item. The item should open a new window.
    <td valign=top>Items can now also be closed while also maintaining the data before the close. I.E, if the forum has dialogue in it and is then closed and reopened, the dialogue will still be there.

  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Kevin Le
    <td valign=top>Adding resizability to windows
    <td valign=top>Open a presentation document and resize the window.
    <td valign=top>The HTML document now resizes to scale with the entire EClass window.
