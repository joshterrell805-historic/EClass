      <td valign=top>View the 'Kick Confirmation' prompt and kick a student.
      <td valign=top>With the Roster window open, click on a student's name and click on the 'Kick' button towards the bottom. Then click 'Accept' to kick the student or 'Cancel' to not kick them.
      <td valign=top>Currently validation is done through the console. When the window opens, the student's initial status is printed. When the window is closed by pressing 'Accept' or 'Cancel', the student's (possibly new) status is printed.

      <td valign=top>Created Host/Join Presentation Prompts and worked on front end utility with Josh.
      <td valign=top>Open the program and login with either 'gfisher' or 'student'. Depending on which, Host or Join will open up.
      <td valign=top>Josh created the backend networking for these prompts that update the data for these dialogs and I worked on getting button functionality working.

      <td valign=top>Basic drawing utility (only works on Windows currently)
      <td valign=top>Open up a presentation (.html file) from the main EClass window. Click anywhere on the Presentation area to render a circle.
      <td valign=top>Currently this only works for Windows, but it has been a struggle just for that. The HTML window does not support mouse click events so we had to do a javascript hack (Josh). We are working on this and will begin implementing it with the drawing tools.

      <td valign=top>Delete a Layer
      <td valign=top>With the Layer Manager Open, select an unlocked layer with the left hand checkboxes then click the 'X' button. The layer is then deleted from the slide.
      <td valign=top>The user will see the layer deleted from the layer manager.

      <td valign=top>Andrew Lisowski
      <td valign=top>Change Opacity of a Layer
      <td valign=top>With the Layer Manager Open, select an unlocked layer with the left hand checkboxes then slide the slider at the top. The layer's opacity is then changed.
      <td valign=top>The user will see the layer's opacity change. This can also be checked by selecting a layer and seeing where the slider set's itself to. This position is the current value of the opacity on the slide.
   <tr>
      <td valign=top>Andrew Lisowski
      <td valign=top>Lock a layer
      <td valign=top>With the Layer Manager Open, check the lock checkbox next to a layer. 
      <td valign=top>Now when the user tries to edit this layer in anyway, the changes arent't made becasue it is now locked.
   <tr>
      <td valign=top>Andrew Lisowski
      <td valign=top>Unique layers on slide
      <td valign=top>With the Layer Manager Open, create a new layer on any slide. Then switch between slides and create more layers. These layers are saved and reloaded as you navigate.
      <td valign=top>Now when the user switches between slides the layer manager shows just the layers associated with that slide.
