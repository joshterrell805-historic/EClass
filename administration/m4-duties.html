      <td valign=top>View the 'Kick Confirmation' prompt and kick a student.
      <td valign=top>With the Roster window open, click on a student's name and click on the 'Kick' button towards the bottom. Then click 'Accept' to kick the student or 'Cancel' to not kick them.
      <td valign=top>Currently validation is done through the console. When the window opens, the student's initial status is printed. When the window is closed by pressing 'Accept' or 'Cancel', the student's (possibly new) status is printed.

      <td valign=top>Created Host/Join Presentation Prompts and worked on front end utility with Josh.
      <td valign=top>Open the program and login with either 'gfisher' or 'student'. Depending on which, Host or Join will open up.
      <td valign=top>Josh created the backend networking for these prompts that update the data for these dialogs and I worked on getting button functionality working.

      <td valign=top>Basic drawing utility (only works on Windows currently)
      <td valign=top>Open up a presentation (.html file) from the main EClass window. Click anywhere on the Presentation area to render a circle.
      <td valign=top>Currently this only works for Windows, but it has been a struggle just for that. The HTML window does not support mouse click events so we had to do a javascript hack (Josh). We are working on this and will begin implementing it with the drawing tools.

      <td valign=top>Delete a Layer
      <td valign=top>With the Layer Manager Open, select an unlocked layer with the left hand checkboxes then click the 'X' button. The layer is then deleted from the slide.
      <td valign=top>The user will see the layer deleted from the layer manager.

      <td valign=top>Andrew Lisowski
      <td valign=top>Change Opacity of a Layer
      <td valign=top>With the Layer Manager Open, select an unlocked layer with the left hand checkboxes then slide the slider at the top. The layer's opacity is then changed.
      <td valign=top>The user will see the layer's opacity change. This can also be checked by selecting a layer and seeing where the slider set's itself to. This position is the current value of the opacity on the slide.

      <td valign=top>Andrew Lisowski
      <td valign=top>Lock a layer
      <td valign=top>With the Layer Manager Open, check the lock checkbox next to a layer. 
      <td valign=top>Now when the user tries to edit this layer in anyway, the changes arent't made becasue it is now locked.

      <td valign=top>Andrew Lisowski
      <td valign=top>Unique layers on slide
      <td valign=top>With the Layer Manager Open, create a new layer on any slide. Then switch between slides and create more layers. These layers are saved and reloaded as you navigate.
      <td valign=top>Now when the user switches between slides the layer manager shows just the layers associated with that slide.

      <td valign=top>Host a presentation (kevin helped with GUI)
      <td valign=top>Once logged in as a presenter (only presenter at the moment is 'gfisher') select a presentation to host for, then click the host button.
      <td valign=top>Hosting can be verifyied ina number of ways. Students may only Join classes that are hosted, so one way to test that a class is actually hosted is to try to join the same
      presentation on a separate EClass process. Another is to look at the output of the server, it should show that 'Gene Fisher is hosting for...'
   <tr>
      <td valign=top>Josh Terrell
      <td valign=top>Join a presentation (kevin helped with GUI)
      <td valign=top>Once a presentation is being hosted, launch up another instance of EClass and login as 'student'. Join the presentation you have hosted on the presenter's computer by selecting the appropriate class and pressing 'Join'.
      <td valign=top>Again, there are several ways to validate. Only classes that are currently hosted may be joined. If you try to join a class that isn't hosted, an error message will display.
      Also, in the presenter's terminal, a message will display stating that 'student' has joined the presentation.
   <tr>
      <td valign=top>Josh Terrell
      <td valign=top>Leave presentation
      <td valign=top>Follow steps above to join a presentation, then exit out of the eclass application.
      <td valign=top>The roster will eventually update (if it isn't by the time this milestone is out). If not, a message is displayed to the presenter's terminal stating that 'student' has left the presentation.
   <tr>
      <td valign=top>Josh Terrell
      <td valign=top>Dynamically update hosted classes in student view.
      <td valign=top>Load up a new student application, and close the presenter application. you should see that all classes are not hosted. Load up an eclass process with presenter logged in and
      host a presentation. On the student application you will see that the class the presenter hosted for now displays as hosted on the student's screen. Close the presenter's application. You will now see that the student's application coreclty shows that the presenter is no longer hosting the a presentation for the class.
