      <td valign=top>View the 'Kick Confirmation' prompt and kick a student.
      <td valign=top>With the Roster window open, click on a student's name and click on the 'Kick' button towards the bottom. Then click 'Accept' to kick the student or 'Cancel' to not kick them.
      <td valign=top>Currently validation is done through the console. When the window opens, the student's initial status is printed. When the window is closed by pressing 'Accept' or 'Cancel', the student's (possibly new) status is printed.

      <td valign=top>N/A
      <td valign=top>The tests and test plans can be found under the testing/implementation/unit/* directories. My class test plans are for Student, Question, StudentPermissions, Presentation, and Slide. My method test plans are written for all the methods in Presentation and Student

      <td valign=top>Created Host/Join Presentation Prompts and worked on front end utility with Josh.
      <td valign=top>Open the program and login with either 'gfisher' or 'student'. Depending on which, Host or Join will open up.
      <td valign=top>Josh created the backend networking for these prompts that update the data for these dialogs and I worked on getting button functionality working.

      <td valign=top>Basic drawing utility (only works on Windows currently)
      <td valign=top>Open up a presentation (.html file) from the main EClass window. Click anywhere on the Presentation area to render a circle.
      <td valign=top>Currently this only works for Windows, but it has been a struggle just for that. The HTML window does not support mouse click events so we had to do a javascript hack (Josh). We are working on this and will begin implementing it with the drawing tools.
