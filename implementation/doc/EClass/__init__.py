"""
EClass is a presentation tool which allows students to interactively follow
a presentation by taking notes on the presentation itself, ask the presenter
questions, rate how well they understand the presentation at any given moment,
and converse in a forum with other students.

There are three types of applications that interact in EClass: EClass
(presenter logged in), EClass (student logged in), and the central server.
Documentation about how these applications interact behind the scenes is
described in the U{networking documentation <THIS_WILL_BE_REMOVED_TO_CREATE_A_RELATIVE_LINK../documentation/design/networking.html>}.
TODO: add link to networking classes.
