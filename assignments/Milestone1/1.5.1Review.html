        <h4 title>1.5.1. Blackboard Virtual Classroom</h1>
        <div style="width: 800px">
         Blackboard Virtual Classroom is used in many highschools throughout 
         the nation today. The application allows student and teacher
         to interact through the web. Blackboard does infact provide
         many of the features required by the specification but does lack a few
         as well. One feature the application allows for is out of the classroom
         lectures, where the teacher is able to broadcast his or her voice
         and video camera feed through the web.
        </div>
        <h4 title>Good Features:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Controls for allowing individual users certain acceses/
             restrictions</li>
            <li>Simple question queue where students are able to ask
             questions and the teacher is able to answer them at his discretion
             </li>
            <li>User list that shows all participants in the classroom and
             their respective role, i.e, student, assistant, teacher</li>
            <li>Capability for lecture slides as well as teacher video and
             audio feed on the same screen</li>
            <li>Whiteboard feature allows for cutting, pasting, and moving items
             on the virtual whiteboard. Free drawing is also available</li>
            <li>Groub browser feature allows a classroom to collectively browse
             the internet, i,e, watch youtube videos, use a web-app</li>
            <li>Can be used as a standalone application or within a browser</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 title>Bad Features:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>GUI is somewhat hard to navigate and many features are jumbled
             together instead of separate buttons for each</li>
            <li>Requires a separate Blackboard account (not student ID) to
             register and login with</li>
            <li>Closed source, so there are no third party extensions to expand
             application capabilities</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 title>Missing Features:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>No way to represent different layers on the whiteboard</li>
            <li>Missing the ability to poll students on level of understanding
             </li>
            <li>No way to expand a topic on a lecture slide for more detail</li>
            <li>Switching between lecture slides and virtual whiteboard is not
             straight forward and requires multiple button presses</li>
            <li>Lecture slides cannot be used to write on directly</li>
            <li>Saving and opening previous whiteboard drawings is not possible
             directly through the application</li>
        </ul>
