- Lets say professor wants multiple people to edit the whiteboard. 
 - Prof gives permission to x people
   - Each person gets their own blank layer.
    - Prof. is able to display each individual layer or any amount of layers.
     - Prof. is able to delete selected or all layers
- idea: screen size is square, combind both side bars that would be empty into a notes section.
- idea: option for the instructor to not show new layers he/she is working on? possible layer property for top viewable layer and bottom viewable layer.
- roster icons: hand, optional slide push request icon, lock icon representing current permissions, gear for overall permissions and kicking a student
- possible roster sorting
 - but definite popping to the top of the list for users with active questions/requests
  - no sorting afterward
- greyed out students who are not present
- Should slides be layers?
 - Could have the originally created slides be different because they have html markup, images, etc.
 - Also more/different options for creating a slide outside of an ongoing presentation
- Problem: when adjusting base presentation, any saved layers from previous presentations may no longer match up with the slides/presentation.
 - Similar issue when collasping and expanding the titles/sections
- Problem: Layers associated with relative slide or section? When section is broke onto multiple slides what happens? (AKA 2 sections on one slide)
