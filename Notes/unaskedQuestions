should students be able to browse lectures at their own pace and follow along?
   What if a student is taking notes and the teacher moves on to the next section?
   It would suck if the student was in the middle of taking notes and his layer
   collapsed because the teacher collapsed the section.

What is the solution to this? The student needs to see what the teacher is doing,
yet he needs to be able to take his own notes too.

Is index.html different than our table of contents file?


clarify on one type of permissions: locking the user's machine to only EC or
only EC and email, etc.
- How should presentations be created? Importing? Creating with markup?
- Do the panes have to absolutely be detachable windows?

-poly id
-year
-major
-etc
