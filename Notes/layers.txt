Layers in the Electronic Classroom

Layers appear over the presentation and may be drawn on. The students and
teacher draw on layers. Layers may be displayed, hidden, created, deleted,
(re)named, and modified.

Modifying layers invlolves changing the content on them or changing the way
in which they are displayed. Layers can have an opaque or transparent background
or any value inbetween. Layers may have text and drawings added to them.

Layers are controlled from the layer console in which layers can have their
transparency changed, be renamed, be displayed or hidden, and be reordered.

The teacher may see all students' layers and choose any to be displayed on the
presentation. 

The teacher may also choose to enable editing by any or all students on a shared
layer.

The electronic classroom is also used as notes for students. 
Since the electronic classroom is used as notes too, students should have a copy
of all of the teacher's layers.

I think saving the notes as image files is out of the question. It will be way
too cumbersome to review notes. In order for these notes to be of any value to
students, the electronic classroom notes must be preserved in a way in which
a student can open the program at a later date and see the notes how they
originally were.

I'm thinking we should have an option to be able to save layers/presentation
to a file for student notes.

The teacher mentioned this tool being for use by students as a note-taking tool
as well as an in-lecture device. If the tool is to be used for note-taking,
there needs to be some way to save the notes.
