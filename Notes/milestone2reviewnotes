- new window/toolbar section for inserting thing like a textbox (especially for creating or editing a presentation)
- keep drawing tools specific to visuals and layer editing
- Can put preparation section at very end and start with actual presentation details
- Overlays = layers
- Polling feature is very low priority to Dr. Fisher
- Make approval tracker simpler
- Chat/text not important right now but could take the place of polling sort of?
