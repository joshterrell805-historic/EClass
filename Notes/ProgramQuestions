1. Approval tracker for current slide. Idea: graph at the end of lecture?
2. Have another tracker for pace. Too fast or too slow. Maybe combine sliders
3. Clarity on expanding and collapsing points
4. Should we automatically save layers when slides collapse/expand
5. Color schemes? GUI design preference?
6. Option to kick student out of virtual classroom?
7. How does authentification work? How do you know which classroom to join?
8. Moderators/TAs?
9. Should we include webcam slots for the instructor and/or student that is selected after raising their hand?
10. Should we include a VoIP option for students, or only text?
11. Do we want automatic attendance checking (aside from the student list)?
12. Student grouping feature for group activities? (like Saba's "Breakout room"s)
13. Do we want the ability to set up reminders for students via email/text?
14. Will this feature recored voice so that students can have the ability to be "in class" without physically being there?
15. Will the professor be able to record lectures/class sessions to be posted on PolyLearn?
16. Can students turn in homework and papers via a file transfer feature?
17. Can we allow students to "take control" of the lecture and either present or answer a question/demonstration to the class?
18. Lecture interations: students can "raise hand" for questions, be polled for questions and general consensus, and have the ability to chat with the professor, a certain student, or the class in general?
19. question about saving layers/notes -- see josh's notes on layering/gimp
20. Should the professor be able to see all of student's layers in the program, or should the student be able to hide/make visible/editable owned layers? to just the teacher? to other students?
